title: A Computer Blog

This site contains my thoughts and articles on computer related stuff. Currently the content is probably a bit Docker and Jolokia biased, but this might slowly shift in the future, depending what's happening. I already see this IoT thingy rising at my horizon (just got my [Wunderbar](https://relayr.io/wunderbar) ;-). My goal is to write one article per month. Hard enough.

### About me

I'm Roland Hu√ü and a Developer (mostly Java) for nearly two decades, live in Franconia, work in Munich and am a Chili Addict.

Yes, and I do Open Source ;-)

My two main projects are [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org), the HTTP/JSON bridge to JMX, and a [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/rhuss/docker-maven-plugin). 

For information about my professional career you can find my profiles on [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Roland_Huss) and [LinkedIn](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/roland-hu%C3%9F/6/860/441/).
