This site contains my thoughts and articles on computer related stuff. Currently the content is probably a bit Docker, Kubernetes, [fabric8](http://fabric8.io) and [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org) biased, but this might slowly shift in the future, depending what's happening. My goal is to write one article per month. Hard enough.

### About me

I am Roland Hu√ü, a developer working for [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/), coding now for over qtwo decades (mostly in Java), live and work in Franconia, love chilis.

And I do Open Source. My two main projects are [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org), the JSON/HTTP bridge to JMX, and a [docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin).
