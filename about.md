This site contains my thoughts and articles on computer related
stuff. Currently the content is probably a bit Docker, Kubernetes,
[fabric8](http://fabric8.io) and [Jolokia](http://www.jolokia.org)
biased, but this might slowly shift in the future, depending what's
happening. I already see this IoT thingy rising at my horizon (just
got my [Wunderbar](https://relayr.io/wunderbar) ;-). My goal is to
write one article per month. Hard enough.

### About me

decades (mostly in Java),
