title: Docker for (Java) Developers
---

Recently I gave a Meetup talk for the [Docker Munich][1] Meetup Group which explained how Docker can help developers to improve integration tests and to ship applications. 
<!-- more -->

The [slides][2] are online as well as the [demo project][3]. 

During the demo I used [Butterfly][4] for an in-browser shell, which was quite cool, I guess ;-) (This is obviously not enabled   in the online slides).

I'm going to continue to celebrate my Docker-♡ with another two talks in autumn:

* [Boosting your developer toolbox with Docker][5] at JBoss One Day Talk, 29. September in Gemering (Munich, Germany)
* [Docker für Java Entwickler][6] (in german) at W-JAX 14, 3. - 7. November in Munich

And there is a slight chance (since the CFP has not yet been declined ;-) to talk at [Devoxx][7] about Docker. [JavaZone][8] unfortunately declined my CFP, I guess there are already too many riding the docker horse (which is a good thing). 

Nevertheless I will attend both conferences with talks about [Jolokia][9], and I'm really looking forward to it.

'guess it will become a hot autumn (hotter than this german 20134 summer for sure) ....
