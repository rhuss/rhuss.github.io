title: Docker for (Java) Developers
---

Recently I gave a Meetup talk for the [Docker Munich Meetup Group][1] which was about how Docker can help developers to improve intergration tests and to ship applications. 
<!-- more --> 

The [slides][2] are online as well as the [demo project][3]. 

During the demo I used [Butterfly][4] for an in-browser shell, which was quite cool, I guess ;-) (This is obviously not enabled   in the online slides).

I'm going to continue to celebrate my Docker-♡ with another two talks in autumn:

* [Boosting your developer toolbox with Docker][5] at [JBoss One Day Talk][6], 29. September in Gemering (Munich, Germany)
* [Docker für Java Entwickler][7] (in german) at [W-JAX 14][8], 3. - 7. November in Munich

And there is a slight chance (since the CFP has not yet been declined ;-) to talk at [Devoxx][9] about Docker. [JavaZone][10] unfortunately declined my CFP, I guess there are already too many riding the docker horse (which is a good thing). 

Nevertheless I will attend both conferences with talks about [Jolokia][11], and I'm really looking forward to it.

'guess it will become a hot autumn (hotter than this german 20134 summer for sure) ....
